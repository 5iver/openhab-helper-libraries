# Helper Libraries for openHAB Scripted Automation

The documentation is located at https://openhab-scripters.github.io/openhab-helper-libraries/index.html.

This repository holds helper libraries for use with openHAB, the new rule engine, and scripted automation.
The main purpose of the helper libraries is to provide a layer of abstraction for simplifying the interaction of scripts and other libraries with openHAB.
The current release of these libraries can be used with [openHAB](http://openhab.org/) 2.4.0 M3 or 2.4.0 S1319 up to 2.5.x.
The one exception is that custom module handlers, including the StartupTrigger, DirectoryTrigger, and OsgiEventTrigger in the Jython helper libraries require openHAB 2.4.0 S1566 or newer.
A previous version of the Jython core libraries that is compatible with earlier versions of openHAB, but with reduced functionality, has been archived to [this branch](https://github.com/OH-Jython-Scripters/openhab2-jython/tree/original_(%3C%3D2.3)).

These works are based on the original contributions of [Steve Bate](https://github.com/steve-bate) ([original Jython repository](https://github.com/steve-bate/openhab-jython)) and [Helmut Lehmeyer](https://github.com/lewie) ([original JavaScript repository](https://github.com/lewie/openhab2-javascript)), for which we are very thankful!  :vulcan_salute:
