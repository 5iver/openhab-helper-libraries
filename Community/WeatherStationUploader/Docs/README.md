# weatherStationUploader v4.0.0
Share your openHAB weather sensors data with the world!  Itâ€™s fun, rewarding, and can help others planning out their day or weekend!

## About
This software is distributed as a community submitted package as a part of [openhab-helper-libraries](https://github.com/openhab-scripters/openhab-helper-libraries). 

**weatherStationUploader** enables personal weather station owners to UPLOAD weather data in real time to Weather Underground.

#### Prerequisits
* [meteocalc](https://github.com/OH-Jython-Scripters/weatherStationUploader/blob/master/README.md#about#meteocalc%20Installation)

## meteocalc Installation
* The [meteocalc library](https://pypi.org/project/meteocalc/) is used for some calculations in the script. It must be installed and accessible from within the openHAB jsr223 environment. There might be other ways but the following was done on a ubuntu installation to achieve that. It might look different on your system.

* `sudo pip install meteocalc`
* Now, openHAB jsr223 jython must be configured to find your downloaded python libraries. There are several ways to do this. You can add a -Dpython.path=mypath1:mypath2 to the OH2 script `/etc/default/openhab2`. For example `-Dpython.path=/etc/openhab2/automation/lib/python:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` You can also modify the sys.path list in a Jython script that loads early (like a component script). Or as an alternative you can create a symlink like `sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/meteocalc /etc/openhab2/automation/lib/python/meteocalc` (In this example, the directory /etc/openhab2/automation/lib/python is already defined as openHAB's python library search path)
* Edit classutils.py, change line 5 to: `PYTHON2 = 2#sys.version_info.major`

## Installation
After the prerequisits are met:
* Register a new PWS (Personal Weather Station) at [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/signup). Note your station ID and station password.

* Follow the instruction for how to [install a community submitted package](../../../Docs/Python/Community.md#installation).

* Edit the configuration dictionary `weatherStationUploader_configuration` that you've previously inserted into the openhab-helper-libraries configuration file. Make sure that the Weather Underground station ID and password are set to match the credentials that you were given when registering your PWS.

* Reload the openhab-helper-libraries configuration as described in [Reload configuration](../../../Docs/But-How-Do-I.md).

* Watch the openHAB debug output for any errors or warnings.
